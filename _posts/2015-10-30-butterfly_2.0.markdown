After 1 year and a half of waiting butterfly 2.0 is finally here!

![butterfly screen cast](/assets/butterfly_2.0_1.gif)

For those who don't know butterfly is an open source in-browser nix terminal written in coffeescript (yeah I know, maybe I will port it to ES7 but you know... braces) and backed up by a python tornado server.


## Features

Its feature list keep on growing:

* xterm compatible (support a lot of unused features!)
* Native browser scroll and search
* Theming in css / sass [(18 preset themes)](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/butterfly-themes) endless possibilities!
* HTML in your terminal! cat images and use &lt;table&gt;
* Multiple sessions support (Ã  la screen -x) to simultaneously access a terminal from several places on the planet!
* Secure authentication with X509 certificates!
* 16,777,216 colors support!
* Keyboard text selection!
* Desktop notifications on terminal output!
* Geolocation from browser!
* May work on firefox too!


## Give it a shot

It's even easier to try it now, just:

```bash
    $ pip install butterfly
    $ pip install libsass  # If you want to use themes
    $ butterfly
```

A new tab should appear in your browser. Then type

```bash
    $ butterfly help
```

To get an overview of butterfly features.

For everyday use, it's better to use a server see below.


## Moar

Go to the [github page](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/butterfly) for more informations, like setting up a server using systemd (I know I know) or why not contributing!

Take a look at existing themes at [butterfly-themes](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/butterfly-themes) and current demos showing the butterfly potential at [butterfly-demos](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/butterfly-demos).

### End

We are in 2015, we can finally display images and html in a terminal and use 16M colors, what a world we are living in.
