The future is here! wdb 3.0 is out get it while it's hot (and certainly bugged)


![Material wdb](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4cd1a4503682803966e706dec1de84b0d178da29/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f4b6f7a65612f7764622f6d61737465722f7764622e706e67)

## Changes

 * A whole new material design lite interface (a bit responsive)
 * Clickable icons instead of hotkeys only
 * Visual distinction between stepping, post_mortem and shell
 * An actually readable help (you can get by clicking on the help icons)
 * A code mirror prompt with syntaxic coloration and more classic completion
 * New commands (open current file in external editor, respawn current process...)
 * A far better post mortem interaction when using ext and wdb is disabled.
 * `importmagic` suggestions on NameError
 * Use of `uncompyle6` to get python source when only byte-code is available
