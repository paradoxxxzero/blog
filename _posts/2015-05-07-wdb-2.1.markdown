Hi everybody!


wdb 2.1 is here with a new more serious light theme:

![wdb light theme](/assets/wdb21_light.png)

and some new features:

  * New completion mechanism, should complete a lot better
  * Experimental object tree search (`.f` command) to look for a key or a value condition in an object
  * Media display in debugger (`.i` command)
  * New diff function to print differences between string / obj / files (`.x` command)
  * Timing for expression evaluation (remote and local)
  * Prompt exception inspection (click on it)
  * A new shell mode and an executable `wdb`
  * A new multiline prompt mode triggered by `[ctrl]` + `[enter]`
  * And a lot of bug fixes


For more features see the [last wdb 2.0 post](/2014/05/12/wdb-2.html) and the [github readme page](https://github.com/Kozea/wdb).
